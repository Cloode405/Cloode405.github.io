<h2>Jay Street Dive</h2>
My butt hurts. I'm fatigued, I'm stressed, I'm watching, I'm thinking... all while this war is going on inside of my head. I know for a fact that these thoughts are not originally my own and that they belong to everyone standing and sitting around me. Anyways, back to where my butt hurts, the classic wooden bench, the smell of piss, and the constant loud screeches and rumblings. Now to anyone it might seem as if I'm describing one of the worst places on Earth. And yeah, I agree that the place I'm describing sounds like shit, but for me, this is the calmest place that isn't a house for me in NYC. Jay Street Subway station is the place that I am talking about. Right off of the A, C, F, or R trains, this station has been the conclusion to my day since I was five years old. Finding myself there after every single day made this a special place for me. But it's not this entire station that makes me feel the way I do. Itâ€™s the classic wooden bench I sit on every day that does. The F train door opens and I enter a colorful station.
The bright light and painfully uncomfortable pew-like benches are my passageways into a connection with my thoughts. As I said, this place is the conclusion of my day. Being the busy teenager I am, I have a constant stream of thoughts traveling throughout my mind. In the constant buzz of everyday life, I am able to find solace and clarity on this bench. I sit after I leave school, chorus practice, the gym, hanging out with my friends, and other activities. I leave all these ventures with conflicting thoughts and within this place, I am able to internalize all of them. I'm able to understand the stress I'm under from school. I'm able to understand what I need to learn for my next performance. I'm able to understand everything that went down during my hangouts with my friends. Being the kid I am living a bustling life I often have unanswered questions about things going on in my life. I find those answers somehow written between the wood chips under me. 
More than analyzing my inner thoughts, the setting of public transportation allows me to analyze the people around me. And in doing that I have found that I identify with a part of literally everyone who I see in this station. From my watchtower, I recognize the students on their way home from school. I recognize the adults on their way home from work. I recognize the teenagers selling candy on the train. I recognize the people like me who have come from literally everywhere and anywhere. I share the stress with the student on their way home to complete an hour of homework. I share the fatigue of adults on their way home from a long way of work. I share the rush you get while performing with the people who put on a show for all train passengers. Within finding a part of me in all the people I see from my bench I also find my inspiration. I hear the music that the obnoxious people with loudspeakers play and log the song in the back of my head. I see and take in the fashion choices that are eye-catching and apply them to my own wardrobe. These people are both interesting in their own right and my inspiration
From all of these people, I have seen in my 11 years of coming to this station I have been able to formulate the definition of a New Yorker. The clear definition that I have formulated are people who shoulder the burden of the chaotic city life all while juggling their own busy lives, the people who are able to travel underground through the horrid smelling tunnels and the slow service. From sitting on that bench I know now that I am a New Yorker. The busy parts of the city, the tired parts of the city, chaotic parts of the city: I am them all. When I see people who come to this place and crumble under the noise and buckle under the chaos, I know that they are not from here. We, the people who endure, are the people of New York.
